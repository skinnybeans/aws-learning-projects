# aws-learning-projects

A series of learning projects to help people get stuck into AWS.

Parts of these projects can be tricky, especially if you haven't got much experience with the command line. The instructions given won't always lead to success the first time. A big part of learning AWS and automation is knowing what error messages mean and how to fix them. If you just run a series of commands that work, but don't understand why each of those commands was necessary, it will be difficult in future for you debug problems.

So don't be disheartened if you find these project hard. I do provide answers to most of the stumbling blocks if you really get stuck. I would encourage you to use them sparingly if possible!

Hopefully, by the end of each project you would have learnt something and had a bit of fun along the way.


Quick rundown of what each project covers:
