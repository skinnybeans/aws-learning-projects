# Project 1

## Clicky Jenkins

Project one to get you introduced to the basics of AWS!

For this project, you will be using the AWS console to create a virtual machine, then log onto that VM to install the jenkins automation server.

## Prerequisites

You'll need to have access to an AWS account.

Everything in this project uses AWS free tier resources so go sign up for a new account now!

## Setting up your account

Once you've created your account, if you navigate to the IAM section of the console you'll see a checklist that looks something like this:

Complete the checklist.

Create a user and add them to the _admin_ user group.

You'll also need to generate an access key and secret id.

## Getting down to business

This document will outline in broad terms what the goals of the mini project will. There will be information left out on exactly how to get some things working.

However! All the information required can be found quite easily doing google searches.

If you get really stuck, there is a walkthrough right down the bottom of the page. I encourage you to use this as a last resort. Troubleshooting problems and finding answers to them is one of the most important skills to have when dealing with tech problems and AWS is no different.

## Goal
Being able to log into a newly installed Jenkins instance and provide the unlock code.

These steps will be done though the AWS console and by SSHing onto the virtual machine that will run Jenkins.

## Steps

This is a high level outline of what needs to happen, if you are after an extra challenge see how far you can get with just these vague directions.

1. Create EC2 instance.

1. SSH onto the instance.

1. Update instance packages.

1. Install Jenkins.

1. Start the Jenkins service.

1. Unlock the Jenkins console.

1. Celebrate!

If you managed to get Jenkins up and running with just those instructions, you probably didn't need to go through this project anyway!
